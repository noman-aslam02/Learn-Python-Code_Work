# Comparison Operators

# ___Equal Comparison Operator(==)___
x = 5
y = 2
print(x == y)  # return false because 5 is not equal to 2

# ___Not equal Comparison Operator(!=)___
x1 = 5
y1 = 2
print(x1 != y1)  # return true because 5 is not equal to 2
# "!=" ka matlab hai statement 'false' honi chaeye tabhi 'true' aeygha

# ___Greater than Comparison Operator(>)___
x2 = 5
y2 = 2
print(x2 > y2)  # return true because 5 is greater than 2

# ___Less than Comparison Operator(<)___
x3 = 5
y3 = 2
print(x3 < y3)  # return false because 5 is not less than 2

# ___Greater than or equal to Comparison Operator(>=)
x4 = 5
y4 = 2
print(x4 >= y4)  # return true because 5 is greater than 2
# true statement k liay kam say kam 'equal number' ya 'greater number' hona chaeye

# ___Less than or equal to Comparison Operator(<=)
x5 = 5
y5 = 2
print(x5 <= y5)  # return false because 5 is not less than 2
# true statement k liay kam say kam 'equal number' ya 'less number' hona chaeye
